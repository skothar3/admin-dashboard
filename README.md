# admin-dashboard

Here is an administrator dashboard page that I built using HTML and CSS. This project used CSS Flexbox and Grid for the layout (Odin project ref: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard).

It incorporates responsive design with Grid auto-fit and fluid font-sizing. Check it out here: https://skothar3.github.io/admin-dashboard/
